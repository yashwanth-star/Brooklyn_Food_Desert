### Understanding Food Deserts

According to the USDA, a food desert is defined as a census tract that meets both low-income and low-access criteria, including:

1. **A poverty rate greater than or equal to 20 percent,** or median family income not exceeding 80 percent of the statewide (rural/urban) or metro-area (urban) median family income.
2. **At least 500 people or 33 percent of the population located more than 1 mile (urban) or 10 miles (rural) from the nearest supermarket or large grocery store.**

Our analysis of the Food Access Research Atlas 2019 aimed to identify census tracts that meet this definition of food deserts (LILA zones). However, the dataset did not reveal any census tracts classified as food deserts.

To delve deeper, we explored various sources such as community blog posts, research papers, and news articles to understand how these census tracts are identified and categorized as food or non-food deserts. While the Food Access Research Atlas provided limited insights, other sources pointed us toward key features to consider when classifying a census tract as a food desert. Factors like **SNAP benefits, poverty rates, and income levels** frequently appeared in areas recognized as food deserts.

To create a comprehensive dataset, we explored the repository of datasets provided on the NaNDA (National Neighborhood Data Archive) website, which included demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, grocery level, etc., along with the Food Access Research Atlas. After experimenting with various combinations of variables, we selected a set of variables to input into clustering algorithms like **K-Means, Gaussian Mixture, and DB Scan.**

    ### Clustering Algorithms and Model Selection

    The selected variables were normalized within a range of 0-100 before being processed by these algorithms. Among them, **DB Scan** emerged as the most effective clustering model, with a silhouette score of 0.56.

    The variables included in the final model were:
    1. **SNAP Benefits:** The proportion of households using SNAP benefits to purchase food.
    2. **Population Earning Less Than $40K.**
    3. **Proportion of Population with Less Than a High School Diploma.**
    4. **Food Index:** A derived variable representing food accessibility.

    The **Food Index** was calculated by combining the number of supermarkets, coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and the poverty rate. We used a weighted average, assigning weights of +0.4 to supermarkets, +0.1 to coffee shops, and -0.5 to fast-food restaurants. These were then combined with the poverty rate to assess healthy food accessibility across Brooklyn's census tracts. The negative weight for fast food restaurants reflects their status as less healthy food options compared to supermarkets and coffee shops.

        ## Importance of Food Policy Reports

        Food policy reports are essential tools for shaping a sustainable and equitable food system. These reports, provided by the New York City Council, offer comprehensive data and insights into various aspects of food production, distribution, and consumption. They help policymakers, stakeholders, and the public understand the current state of the food landscape and the impact of food policies.

        ### Why Food Policy Reports Matter

        1. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Food policy reports compile critical data from multiple sources, offering a detailed analysis of food-related issues. This information is crucial for making informed decisions that affect food security, nutrition, and public health.

        2. **Tracking Progress**: These reports track the progress of food-related initiatives and programs over time. By evaluating trends and outcomes, policymakers can assess the effectiveness of existing policies and identify areas needing improvement.

        3. **Addressing Food Insecurity**: Food policy reports highlight the prevalence and causes of food insecurity. By understanding the root causes, policymakers can implement targeted strategies to ensure that all community members have access to nutritious and affordable food.

        4. **Promoting Healthy Eating**: The reports provide insights into dietary trends and health outcomes, guiding initiatives that promote healthy eating habits. They support programs aimed at reducing diet-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, by increasing access to healthy food options.

        5. **Sustainability and Justice**: Food policy reports emphasize the importance of creating a sustainable and just food system. They address environmental impacts, food waste, and social equity, advocating for practices that protect the planet and ensure fair treatment for all workers within the food supply chain.

        6. **Public Awareness and Engagement**: By making food policy reports accessible to the public, these documents foster greater awareness and engagement. Citizens can better understand the challenges and opportunities within the food system and participate in shaping policies that affect their communities.
